# Algorithms in Python for DevOps

This repository contains examples of algorithms implemented in Python, focusing on helping **DevOps Engineers** and enthusiasts understand and practice key algorithms. The aim is to build foundational skills by exploring algorithmic concepts and solving coding challenges.

## ðŸ“š Topics Covered
The repository is organized into folders, each dedicated to a specific category of algorithms. These categories include, but are not limited to:

1. **Hash Table**: Efficient key-value storage and lookup techniques.
2. **String**: Manipulation and pattern-matching operations.
3. **Stack**: Managing last-in-first-out (LIFO) operations, often used in parsers or memory management.
4. **Sliding Window**: Optimization techniques for processing data streams or arrays.
5. **Heap (Priority Queue)**: Efficient data retrieval with priority-based access.
6. **Sorting**: Fundamental methods for ordering data, crucial for data pipelines and automation.
7. **Prefix Sum**: Useful for cumulative calculations in arrays.
8. **Greedy**: Optimization strategies for solving problems step-by-step.
9. **Graph**: Algorithms for managing dependencies, topological sorting, and network flows.
10. **Dynamic Programming**: Solving complex problems by breaking them into simpler sub-problems.
11. **Two Pointers**: Efficient techniques for traversing data structures.
12. **Lists and Arrays**: Core operations and optimizations for handling structured data.

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose
The focus of this repository is on **understanding** and **practicing** algorithms rather than their real-world implementations. Each example is written in Python to help grasp the core concepts. To practice these algorithms further, solving challenges on platforms like **LeetCode** is highly encouraged.

## ðŸš€ How to Use
